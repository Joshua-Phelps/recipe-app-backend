Flat Plate is an app designed to organize and store recipes. A user can create, update, delete,  favorite, and rate recipes. A search tool provides filtering by area and category as well as the ability to find recipes by name. 

Flat Plate uses a Ruby on Rails backend and PostgreSQL database. The front end was built with React.

I built this project with two other team members for our mod-4 project at Flatiron School in Seattle

To start:

- Fork and clone repo
